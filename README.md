# AutomationProject
Latest Automation Project using Selenium and Java

As part of automation project on an qa course, 
I was requested to check the process of purchasing items in this site

I created a test that chooses 2 random items in the site and setting different quantities to each item.
I checked numerous objects on the site (the exsistence of sign in and sign out buttons, checking the totals
mentioned in the purchasing process are correct and accurate).

I used the Junit method in this project (and the basic of POM).
